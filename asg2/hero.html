The series revolves around the titular Scott Pilgrim, a slacker and part-time musician who lives in Toronto and plays bass in a band, dating a high school student while recovering from a traumatic breakup. He starts a tentative romance with American delivery girl Ramona Flowers, soon discovering that Ramona possesses superpowers. It transpires that her seven supervillain exes have similar abilities. They are manipulated into targeting Scott in combat by her most recent ex boyfriend, Gideon Graves, forcing both Scott and Ramona to come to terms with their respective pasts, relationships, and behaviors.[4]
