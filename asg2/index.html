    <h1>Assignment 2: Readings + 3 Websites for inspiration</h1>
    <p>1. I learned from from "Critical Web Design Chp 0" (couldnt find pdf to read from) </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>2. I learned from from "Evolution of the Web" about how far we have come from the internet,
    with static web pages with limited interactivity to the introduction of blockchain and how it changed data ownership.
    I was especially interested in how the Web 2.0 rought interactive experiences and user-generated content. 
    Innovations such as blogs, social media, APIs, AJAX, and JavaScript frameworks emerged. We also saw the rise of platforms 
    like YouTube, Wikipedia, Flickr, Facebook, and WordPress exemplify this era</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>3. I learned from from "Wax and Wane of the Web" about the different standards the web harbored,
    it was interesting hearing about how we went from only choosing 4 fonts, to learning how CSS, Java, PHP, and .NET became
    more popular to use as well. The article says to keep learning and making the standards of the web improve, even if 
    we keep seeing the same design and development choices being made. Specifically, the author relates the web’s evolution to raising a child
    It’s a cycle of growth, decay, and renewal, driven by constant learning and adaptation. He urges creators to “learn, make, share, grow." To 
    basically contribute uniquely to the internet, share, and build a better web together.</p>

    <p> Semester Project Selection: 
        I've decided to go with a website that helps those from underprivleged communities gain access to scholarships and 
        free education (partnering people with scholarships that match their demographic, or with free programs depending on 
        what people are interested in)
