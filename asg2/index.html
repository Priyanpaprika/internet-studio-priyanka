                Question 1. Structured content is about organizing information into meaningful, reusable chunks that 
                can be understood by both humans and machines. It emphasizes separating content from presentation so it 
                can work across multiple platforms like websites, apps, or voice assistants. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, 
                is about using the correct HTML tags to communicate the meaning of content (like headings, lists, or sections) 
                instead of just focusing on how it looks.
            <br><br>
                Question 2: Structured content and semantic HTML complement each other by making sure content is both well-organized 
                and properly expressed in code. Structured content provides the logical breakdown—like labeling a section as “steps in 
                a recipe” or “product details” while semantic HTML marks those sections with the right tags.
            <br><br>
                Question 3: Having both structured content and semantic HTML is essential because it improves accessibility, search visibility, 
                and overall user experience. Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML to navigate content, while 
                structured content ensures that information is clear and consistent across different platforms. This not only benefits users 
                by giving them faster, more accurate information but also helps businesses increase reach and credibility online.

               Question 1. The method I am defenitely going to use is “Be bad, very bad." 
                Purposefully doing something poorly or “badly” to remove the perfectionist fear that often holds me back. 
                This works well for me because perfectionism is one of my biggest blocks; once I give myself permission to 
                do a sloppy first draft or experiment without caring about the outcome, it frees up creativity. So combining 
                “Switch it up” (for mindset) with “Be bad, very bad” (for doing) seems like it would help banish the inner 
                critic more sustainably for me.
            <br><br>
                Question 2: Hyperbolic discounting is a cognitive bias where we favor smaller-sooner rewards over larger-later 
                rewards in a way that changes over time: what seems worth waiting for in the future becomes less attractive the 
                nearer “now” gets. For me, the most helpful would be using precommitment. I often know what I should be doing, 
                but when the moment comes, I tend to give in to the easier option (social media or lighter tasks). If I set up a 
                system ahead of time that makes distractions harder to access, or force myself to commit to interim deadlines, I 
                think I’d be much more likely to follow through. 
            <br><br>
                Question 3: I think network-making power might be the one where we have both the ability to create and publish our work, but 
                we are also still under the mercy of those who have controlled the internet before and have programmed the web to push insidious 
                agenda's such as white supremacism for instance. It is a weird predicament as we are in the age where we are able to make and 
                put out into the world, different types of media that have potential to become popular and respected by everyone. Or it could 
                get surpressed by algorithms created in the past by those who wanted to utilize the internet for different reasons.
