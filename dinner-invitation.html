    <h2>Greta Thunburg</h2>
        <p>I am a big fan of Greta Thunburgs work, we owe a lot to her in terms of student activism and also for her 
bringing awareness to climate change, war, and world hunger. Her initiative with helping with the Palestinian genocide by embarking 
in that flotilla is also super admirable, and she deserves to be rewarded for her hard work with a delicious meal! </p>

    <h2>Terri Joe</h2>
        <p>Terri Joe never fails to make me laugh and her energy is something that I'm curious to see the other participants
work with. She is a good christian southern woman and her values are very debatable, but still a pleasure nonetheless. </p>

    <h2>Vic Michealis</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite comedians ever, I love them to bits and peices. I feel like they would know how to handle 
both Terri and Greta's energy well. Vic has been there for my saddest times and no one else does humor quite like them.</p>
