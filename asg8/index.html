			<h2> Discussion with my Classmate</h2>
				<p> The main thing that I am trying to accomplish with my domain name is capitalize on the fact that my website can look for different scholarships and nonprofits near you. So words like search, finder, or Look, could work in the potential domain name. It is also going to be combined with something relating to education because this is specifically for students or parents of students to try and find different areas around them that offer these services.</p>
			
	    <h2> The Domain I Like the Best... </h2>
    			<p> Although it is a bit expensive ($4,895 for the first year!) I really like scholarsearch because it kind of boils down the scholarship and course finding process to a T. It is for scholars, who are looking to search for different oppurtunities! So I think naming it scholarsearch also makes it broad enough for many people to use as well, as this site is also geared towards parents looking for oppurtunities for their kids. </p>
