    <h1>Assignment 1: 3 Things I learned from the readings</h1>
    <p>1. I learned from from "Critical Web Design Chp 0" (couldnt find pdf to read from) </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>2. I learned from from "Evolution of the Web" about how far we have come from the internet,
    with static web pages with limited interactivity to the introduction of blockchain and how it changed data ownership</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>3. I learned from from "Wax and Wane of the Web" about the different standards the web harbored,
    it was interesting hearing about how we went from only choosing 4 fonts, to learning how CSS, Java, PHP, and .NET became
    more popular to use as well. The article says to keep learning and making the standards of the web improve, even if 
    we keep seeing the same design and development choices being made.</p>
