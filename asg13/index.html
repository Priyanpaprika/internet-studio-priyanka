  <h1>My Dream Job's</h1>
  <div class="gridContainer">
    <div class="box a">Company Name: Gamer's Choice 
      <h2>Job Title: Marketing Director<h2>
       <a href="https://ats.rippling.com/gamerschoice/jobs/c358ccb8-5cce-4de0-b0e4-4ede1d61418a">Link to Job</a>
        <p>Explanation: Why it would be nice: This company is known as a place where people can host card tournaments, gatherings, and events related to Trading Card Games. I feel like a place like this would be so fun to design for, especially because I feel like there would be so many different types of ideas I could come up with in order to try and market them. This company also hosts so many different types of events, so I would be able to work on multiple projects without feeling burnt out in one category. Not to mention the pay is pretty good!  <p>

      <div class="box b">Company Name: Micheal Kors
        <h2>Job Title: VP, Global Brand Marketing & Media<h2>
          <a href="https://capri.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Michael_Kors/job/NY-Metro-Area/VP--Global-Brand-Marketing---Media_R_780930?mode=job&iis=Job+Board&iisn=Indeed">Link to Job</a>
          <p>Explanation: Michael Kors is a brand that is very popular within women’s fashion spaces. It would be a really fun opportunity to be able to design their social media page and do fun brand campaigns for them. Media has also become a stronger suit of mine as of late, which would also make this job ideal for my current skill set as well.<p>

      <div class="box c">Company Name: iHeartMedia, INC
        <h2>Job Title: UX Designer<h2>
          <a href="https://iheartmedia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/External_iHM/job/New-York-NY-55th-St/UX-Designer_Req36736-3">Link to Job</a>
          <p>Explanation: iHeartRadio is a music company, and I feel like working for these guys would be a great way to get into the UX Design scene while also working in music- an industry I am very interested in. Another thing about iHeartRadio would be how much they are also based in New York, which is a place I would like to try living in one day. <p>
