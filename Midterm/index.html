<h2>About Ba Sing Se:</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Ba Sing Se is one of Earth Kingdom's constituent states, encompassing a large portion of the nation's northeastern corner. After the Surrender of Omashu, the city became the last great Earth Kingdom stronghold during the Hundred Year War.
	The city is by far the largest in the world, essentially being more of a small country than a mere city. As a testament to its grandeur, the Earth Kingdom's roadway network is centered on the city. Ba Sing Se means "Impenetrable City"; it is so named for its world-famous walls, the gates of which have no hinges or other hardware and are opened by the use of earthbending. </p>
