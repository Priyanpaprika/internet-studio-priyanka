	<h1>Design Statement </h1>

	<br>
	<h2>Visual & Interaction Design choices</h2>
	<br>
	<p>I wanted to curate the site to give a proper vibe of the Earth kingdom, which is what Ba Sing Se is a part of. I thought that the green tones of the Earth Kingdom was something I wanted to showcase (hence the light and dark greens scattered throughout the site. I wanted to use Trebuchet MS because I felt like this font was the most easiest for users to read, and especially for those coming to congregate at the Earth kingdom from all over the world, it would make sense if it was a font that was easily readable and accessible for people. The buttons on the menu were all going to be placed in the top row which is normally how people navigate buttons in websites, so I made sure to put a return button for each webpage to make it easier to return. </p>
