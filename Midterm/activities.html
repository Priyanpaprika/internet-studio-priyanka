	<h1>Activities to Do in Ba Sing Se</h1>

	<br>
	<h2>Fancy Lady Day Spa</h2>

	<p>The Fancy Lady Day Spa is an Upper Ring establishment for pampering noblewomen that has a university attached to it where students can experiment with new ideas on actual customers who, in return, receive a discount on their spa day. Its popularity attracted Katara and Toph (from the hit show Avatar!) during their day off, and they both enjoyed their experience there despite the latter's early misgivings.</p>


	
	<h2>Firelight Fountain</h2>

	<p>Located in the Middle Ring, the Firelight Fountain is popular with citizens who come to feed the turtle ducks in the day, and considered by Jin to be the most romantic spot in town at night. (Jin took Zuko here at the end of their date) The fountain is encircled by lanterns that brighten the entire area. There is a stone structure in the middle with a top center lamp and a lower level of lamps, and lanterns floating in the water.</p>

	<h2>Garden Market</h2>

	<p>Garden Market is one of the busiest sectors of the Lower Ring in Ba Sing Se. Here residents shop for fresh food, including vegetables, meats from vendors like Butcher Hu, and roast duck from vendors like Tall Sek. Given the close proximity to Wen Bakery, citizens often visit it for a sweet treat after completing their regular shopping</p>
