    <h1> The Guide to Wireframing </h1>
        <br>
        <h2> What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software? </h2>    
            <p>
                Sketching wireframes is fast, flexible, and encourages creativity since it allows designers to explore ideas freely without software constraints. Itâ€™s great for brainstorming and early collaboration because it feels informal and invites feedback. It enables reusable components, interactive linking, and smoother progression to prototypes. The downside is that it can slow early ideation and tempt designers to focus too much on visuals rather than functionality.

        <h2> Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why. </h2> 
            <p>
               For my project, a hybrid wireframing approach works best starting with hand-drawn sketches to quickly generate and discuss ideas, then moving into digital wireframes for refinement and testing. Sketching helps define structure and content hierarchy early, while software tools ensure precision, version control, and team collaboration. This method balances creativity with practicality, allowing me to iterate quickly at the start and efficiently refine the design as the project develops.
