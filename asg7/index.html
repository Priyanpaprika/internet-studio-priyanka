		<h2> Vice President: Troye Sivan </h2>
			<h3> Why Would He be a good running mate? </h3>
				<p> He would be a fantastic running mate because he is, if not as influential as Charlie in the music and LGTBQ space. Although these two are musicians and don't have experience within the law making space, they defenitely have a lot to say about the state of the world nowadays and are arguably more emotionally mature than our current president and vice president. </p>

		<h2> Presidency: Charlie XCX</h2>
		        <img src="Charli_XCX" alt="Charli XCX" width="300px" height= "auto">

			<h3>Biography: </h3>
				<p> Charlie is a very amazing pop icon that a lot of demographics look up to and listen to. She has been making music since 2008, starting off in the London rave scene to then making music for other pop artists such as Selena Gomez, Iggy Azealia and more. She collaborates with artists of LGTBQ orgin, and as a British Indian woman herself, it was huge for someone like her to advocate for letting marginalized communities into the music space. </p>
			<h3> Why would she make a good president!</h3>
				<p> Charlie would make a good president because so many people look up to her, especially the LGTBQ commmunity. It would be so nice to have a president that actually advocated for LGTBQ+ rights. Not to mention to have a pop star/producer as a president would be amazing and would be a refreshing change.</p>

	<h2> Top Campaign Platform: </h2>
		<h3> Acceptance for Marginalized Communities </h3>
			<p> Their campaign would definitely run on making sure those within the Trans, LGBTQ, and other marginalized communities were feeling more accepted and that their rights were fought for. Troye and Charlie both are representations of these two communities so they would advocate for gay marriage, trans-affirming health care, and they would also be pop stars while doing it which is so slayyyy queen. </p>
