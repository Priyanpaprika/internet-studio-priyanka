        <h2>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles:</h2>
            <p>
               Framing your project like a story can help the reader/or who ever is trying to understand your design, follow through it in an 
              engaging way. By offering a beginning, middle, and end, it helps the reader connect with the final product more, after they have
              understood what exactly went into the process of making it. Making things is a process, one that can be documented in a story, as
              stories have climaxes, beginnings, and rising actions, similar is the process of making a project. There must of been times in
              the process of the project where you were not sure whether you could make a feature, or felt like trashing it, and conflicts like 
              these are interesting to users. It invokes a sense of emotion in the reader than can't be brought out by just delivering the product
              as is without any prior back-story.

        <h2>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography</h2>
            <p>
               A good way to establish hierarchy within design, is to make sure that you get the reader to look at, what you want them to look 
              at first (the title screen, and then the call-to-action.) Emphasis can be stressed by size, weight, color, style and placement.
                (also I thought this reading was awesome, the way they utilized the romantic phrases sprinkled here and there to emphasize 
                typography elements was so creative.)

      <h1>Creative Brief for Semester Project</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Problem</h2>    
            <p> 
                The problem that this website is trying to solve is that: there are not enough resources out there to point people 
                from marginalized background towards physical areas where there is free education, or there is not a site that finds all
                the online programs that help with free education. 
            </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>  
            <p> 
                My audience is going to be people from low-income families, particularly students or the parents of these students 
                looking for resources 
            </p>
        <h2>Competition</h2>    
            <p> 
                Khan Academy, IXL Math, eDX
            </p>
        <h2>Key Messages</h2>    
            <p> 
                "Education for Everyone." "For Lovers of Learning" I'm thinking something holistic like this is more attractive 
                than something like "Affordable education" because from what I've researched, no one wants to be associated with 
                charitable learning centers- unless it is already established for a while (e.g. Khan Academy, YMCA, etc)
            </p>
        <h2>Call to Action</h2>    
            <p> 
                "Find your study match" "Look for centers around you" I think that maybe there should be an option for the 
                user to find out what type of center they would like to look for first before they end up on the page to find specifically 
                which center they would like. Types of centers: non-profits near me, online academies, online degrees, financial-aid friendly 
                institutions (there is a better way to word that but it is not coming to mind.)
            </p>
        <h2>How to Measure Success</h2>    
            <p> 
                How well the website is able to navigate the user around the site (If I conduct a study and get at least a 70% sucess rate)
                If I can get a fully functioning website thats visually appealing by the end of the semeseter.
            </p>
        <h2>Google Fonts Selection</h2>    
            <p> 
              Heading font: Zalando Sans
                <br>
              Paragraph font: Montserrat
            </p>
