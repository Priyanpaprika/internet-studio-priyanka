        <h2>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles:</h2>
            <p>
               Framing your project like a story can help the reader/or who ever is trying to understand your design, follow through it in an 
              engaging way. By offering a beginning, middle, and end, it helps the reader connect with the final product more, after they have
              understood what exactly went into the process of making it. Making things is a process, one that can be documented in a story, as
              stories have climaxes, beginnings, and rising actions, similar is the process of making a project. There must of been times in
              the process of the project where you were not sure whether you could make a feature, or felt like trashing it, and conflicts like 
              these are interesting to users. It invokes a sense of emotion in the reader than can't be brought out by just delivering the product
              as is without any prior back-story.

        <h2>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography</h2>
            <p>
               A good way to establish hierarchy within design, is to make sure that you get the reader to look at, what you want them to look 
              at first (the title screen, and then the call-to-action.) Emphasis can be stressed by size, weight, color, style and placement.
