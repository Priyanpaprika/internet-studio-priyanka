		<h2>Why I Love Them</h2>
			<p>This band made my middle school and high school years more better for sure. Hayley William's amazing voice really touched my heart, all throughout my emo/punk and alternative indie phases as well. They have has a lot of line-up changes, and things happen, but they still hold a very big place in my heart.</p>
